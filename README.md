# Datalytics-Tech (NO BACKEND)

Here is the Datalytics-Tech site for my business consulting site which I started in June 2022 - Dec. 2023. I've always worked 40+ hours during college while finishing my degree in 5 semesters with an average of 20 credits a semester. I was really passionate about the business as I was able to help over 100 clients over the 1.5 years that I continued the company. 

While I took down the backend and replaced it with a simple Google Form, the original site was built using Flask as it was still a simple application. Also, the original domain name and business email is gone so that was fun while it lasted. I updated the frontend as there is no remains of screenshots as my old laptop broke which contained them in the local drive which of course was not save :(. Definitely was useful in helping me pay for college at least!
